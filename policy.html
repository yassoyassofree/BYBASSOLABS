            <h2>AI Enforcement</h2>
            <p>To ensure compliance with this policy, we have implemented an advanced AI system that monitors user activities. This AI actively detects and reports:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Users disobeying the rules, such as sharing website information or complaining to teachers.</li>
                <li>Account stealing attempts or unauthorized access.</li>
                <li>Scamming violations or other prohibited actions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="warning">The AI operates 24/7 and automatically flags violations for admin review. Non-compliance may lead to immediate bans.</p>
        </div>

        <p class="highlight">Remember: This website is for fun and unblocking games. Follow these rules to keep the community safe and enjoyable. Violations are taken seriously.</p>
